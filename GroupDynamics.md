**Joe Zhang**
My leadership style (**bold** one):

What technical niche would you like to fill?  
(2-5 bullets)
* I'd like to help a lot on the concept of the game, or the specifics of it. I think my gaming background has trained me for this moment.
* I would like all our code to be consistant and easily readable. Clear code with good comments.
* If we were to have a website, I think my knowledge of web development would suit this job well. This also relates to advertising and getting the game out there.
* I also really enjoy playing and noticing every detail of a game so I think bug testing would fit me.

What personal niche would you like to fill?  
(1-3 bullets)
* I want to be the mediator between the team. Making sure there are no conflicts and everyone is happy.
* I want to make sure everything is going smoothly and help those in need.


**Willem Klein Wassink**
My leadership style (**Analyst & Architect**): 

What technical niche would you like to fill?  
(2-5 bullets)
* Personally, I don't really like dealing w/ client/server communication.
* I much prefer determining behavior for NPCs and capabilities for player avatars.
* I would also like to do some management of documentation. We should probably establish some conventions.

What personal niche would you like to fill?  
(1-3 bullets)
* I like to set up a clear plan of how to divide work up and follow it.
* However, I think flexibility is key. If the plan doesn't seem to be fulfilling its goals, we shouldn't hold too tightly to it.


## I. Communication
*You are required to spend at least 10 hours/week outside of class. Outline a general weekly meeting schedule with at least 1 time that everybody can make. That one meeting must include the entire team in the same room, in person. The rest of the 10 hours may be split into several sessions throughout the week. A nice tool for this is [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/).*

### Schedule
* 2:30 - 3:30 PM Mondays
* 2:30 - 3:30 PM Wednesdays
* 12:00 - 1:00 PM Saturdays

### Responsiveness
*How often should team members be expected to check and respond on Slack?*
Team members should be expected to check slack everyday as it will be our main form of communication. Team members should turn notification on 


## II. Decision Making

### Group
*What types of decisions need to be discussed and approved by the entire group?*
 * Splitting up tasks
 * Game features
 * Technology to use
 * General documentation
 * Assets

### Individual
*What types of decisions can be made by a single person?*
  * Coding implementation choices
  * Specific documentation

## III. Conflict Resolution
There are three main types of conflict that tend to occur in group projects:

* **Creative differences**: disagreement on any decisions related to the product
* **Personal differences**: friction between people due to manner or words said
* **Ghosting**: consistent missed deadlines or lack of contribution

Your group should decide on a plan of action to deal with each type of conflict. There can be multiple levels to each plan. Involving the instructors (Tim or Kate) can be part of the plan.

Try to be as specific as possible. 
* A bad plan for Ghosting: “Talk to the person.” (too vague)
* A better plan for Ghosting: “Elect the team member who is closest with that person to check in with them one-on-one. Based on the conversation, reexamine the tasks currently on that person’s plate and revise if necessary. Affirm that they are coming to the next team meeting. At the next team meeting, every team member will make an effort to include the Ghoster in any team discussions.”

### Course of Action
*What will your group do in order to resolve each type of conflict? (include the levels of escalation)*
  * Creative differences can be resolved through voting. Each person should be able to present to the group on why their idea is best and then a vote will be conducted.
  * Personal differences can be resolved through mediation by the third group member in the case of conflict between two team members.
  * Ghosting can be resolved through maintaining Slack channel communication. If someone becomes unresponsive through Slack, we will share the Slack records with the prof and come up with a plan for future communication.


The End!
