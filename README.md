# Together

An online co-op multiplayer game in which players must work together to maintain their daily lives in the midst of a pandemic.

## Architecture

*This is preliminary, potentially subject to change*

* Game will consist of two Gamemaker Studio 2 Projects, one for the backend server, and one for the frontend client
  * The server will have to run to accept connections from players. One should exist for each given game. We may need an uber-server at some point to create them
  * The client connects to a server and plays the game

## Setup

All that's needed to begin working is Gamemaker Studio 2 installed on your computer

## Deployment

With a liscense, we can have Gamemaker Studio 2 export the project as an executable
