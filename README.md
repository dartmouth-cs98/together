# Untitled Pandemic Game (Tentative title: Together)

An online co-op multiplayer game in which players must work together to maintain their daily lives in the midst of a pandemic.

## Architecture

*This is preliminary, potentially subject to change*

* Game will consist of two Gamemaker Studio 2 Projects, one for the backend server, and one for the frontend client
  * The server will have to run to accept connections from players. One should exist for each given game. We may need an uber-server at some point to create them.
  * The client connects to a server and plays the game.

## Setup

TODO: how to get the project dev environment up and running, npm install etc, all necessary commands needed, environment variables etc
